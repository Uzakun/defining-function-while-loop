       #Defining Function           
#syntax:-
# def my_function(): #you can write any                         thing u want in place                      of --- my_function 
#   do this
#   then do this
#  .
#  .
#  .
#  .
#   finally do this
#but if we run the code it will not work, so to make this code work we have to do something called "calling function"
#Callling function in this case would be ---- my_function().
#Example
# def name():
#   print("Her name is:- ")
#   print("Hazel")
# name()  

             #while loop:-
#while Something_is_true:
 #Do Something Repeatedly
